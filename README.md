## ðŸ“Œ Abstract

The LED Thermometer is an intuitive temperature measurement device that uses a series of LEDs to visually represent ambient temperature. It is built using the LM35 temperature sensor, LM3915 IC, and 10 LEDs. As the temperature rises, more LEDs light up. This project serves as a practical application for environmental monitoring, educational purposes, and industrial systems.

## ðŸ”¬ Working Principle

1. **LM35 Temperature Sensor**: Produces an analog voltage proportional to temperature. (+10 mV/Â°C)
2. **LM3915 LED Driver IC**: Converts the analog signal from LM35 into a logarithmic LED bar display.
3. **LEDs**: Represent different temperature levels visually.
4. **Power Supply**: A 9V battery powers the circuit.

As temperature increases, the voltage output of the LM35 rises. The LM3915 lights up more LEDs based on the input voltage, providing a simple and real-time visual cue.
